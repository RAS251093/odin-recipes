            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 220 °C/200 °C fan/Gas 7.</li>
                <li>Mix together the self-raising flour and a pinch of salt to the mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the cubed butter and rub in with the tips of your fingers until the mixture resembles fine crumbs.</li>
                <li>Stir in the caster sugar.</li>
                <li>Measure out the milk into the measuring jug.</li>
                <li>Crack the egg into the jug, and beat until combined.</li>
                <li>Stir the egg and milk mixture into the crumbs until a soft, <em>but not wet</em> dough forms (you may not need all the liquid).</li>
                <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                <li>Knead lightly and work in the sultanas if using.</li>
                <li>Roll out into a rectangle, about 2 cm thick.</li>
                <li>Using the round cutter, cut into as many scones as possible, placing them onto the lined baking tray.</li>
                <li>Brush the scones with a little extra milk, or any leftover egg/milk mixture.</li>
                <li>Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones are well risen and a pale, golden-brown colour.</li>
                <li>Once removed from the oven, lift onto a wire rack and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Enjoy warm or cold, served with strawberry jam and clotted cream, or just plain!</li>
